## Key KPI Questions
- What is the total number of loan applications, and how has it changed month-over-month?
- What percentage of loan applications get funded, and how much is the total funded amount?
- What is the total amount received from loans, and how does it compare to the funded amount?
-  What percentage of loans are classified as bad loans, and what is their financial impact?
-   What is the average interest rate across different loan categories?
-   How does the Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio vary among loan types and borrower profiles?
-   What are the most common reasons for loan applications, and how do they impact approval rates?
-   How do loan applications vary by employment length, homeownership status, and state?

##Project Insights
- A total of 38.6K loan applications were received, showing a steady month-over-month growth of 6.91%. The highest number of applications peaked at 4.3K in the most recent month
- 86.18% of loans were successfully funded, with a total funded amount of $435.8M. Among these, $370.2M was allocated to good loans, reflecting a strong approval rate
- 13.82% of loans were classified as bad loans, totaling 5.3K applications. These loans had a funded amount of $65.5M, but only $37.3M was received, indicating repayment risks
- The average interest rate is 12.05%, but bad loans have a higher interest rate of 13.9%, suggesting lenders charge more for riskier borrowers
- Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio averages at 13.33%, with bad loans showing a higher risk at 14.9%, which may indicate a correlation between higher DTI and loan defaults
- Debt consolidation (18.2K applications) and credit card loans (5K applications) are the most common loan purposes, suggesting a high demand for financial restructuring
- Borrowers with 10+ years of employment have the highest loan applications (8.9K), indicating that longer employment history may increase loan eligibility
- The highest number of loan applications came from specific states (6.8K in the top state), showing regional differences in loan demand and financial behavior
- 36-month loans (28.2K applications) are more popular than 60-month loans (10.3K applications), suggesting borrowers prefer shorter repayment periods
- Renters (18.4K) apply for loans more frequently than mortgage holders (17.1K) and homeowners (2.8K), possibly due to financial constraints or lack of collateral

##Coclusion
- This dashboard helped me understand key trends in loan approvals, funding, and risks. I noticed that while most loans get funded, a significant portion still falls into the bad loan category, which could be a risk factor. Borrowers seem to prefer shorter loan terms, and debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose. Interest rates and debt-to-income ratios also play a major role in loan performance. These insights can be useful for making better lending decisions and improving risk management
